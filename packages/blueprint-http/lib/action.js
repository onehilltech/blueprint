 *
 * The event API for the actions is different from the traditional Events API where
 * the events correspond to objects on this class. Because you cannot gain access to
 * an Action instance (i.e., it is kept internally), the Events correspond to the
 * application. This is equivalent to saying the Action supports the ApplicationMessaging
 * events. We do not use the ApplicationMessaging mixin, however, because we can gain
 * access to the application object via the `controller` property.
